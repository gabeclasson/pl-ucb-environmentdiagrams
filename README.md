This tool allows environment diagramming problems to be hosted and graded on [PrairieLearn](https://www.prairielearn.com/), an online assessment system. Environment diagrams are a kind of interactive program visualization exercise where students are asked to execute a program as a computer would and draw out a diagram representing the state of the computer. 

Our version of this tool is based on the diagramming and visual conventions of [PythonTutor](https://pythontutor.com/cp/composingprograms.html#mode=edit), a popular program visualization website. The styling of Python Tutor was originally released under an open-source license and is used with permission.

## Demos
You can try out a [front-end-only version of our user interface](https://gabeclasson.github.io/pl-ucb-environmentdiagrams/frontend-demo.html),
which will allow you to create an environment diagram as a student would but will not allow you to save or grade it. 

We've also created demo videos for both the instructor and the student interfaces, which you can see below. 

## Documentation
You can read documentation about how to use and set up the element on the [wiki](https://github.com/gabeclasson/pl-ucb-environmentdiagrams/wiki). 

## SIGCSE TS
We presented a poster about our tool at the SIGCSE Technical Symposium in February 2025.
