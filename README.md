# PL Environment Diagram Element
This tool allows environment diagramming problems to be hosted and graded on [PrairieLearn](https://www.prairielearn.com/), an online assessment system. Environment diagrams are a kind of interactive program visualization exercise where students are asked to execute a program as a computer would and draw out a diagram representing the state of the computer. 

Our version of this tool is based on the diagramming and visual conventions of [PythonTutor](https://pythontutor.com/cp/composingprograms.html#mode=edit), a popular program visualization website. The styling of Python Tutor was originally released under an open-source license and is used with permission.

## Demos
You can try out a [front-end-only version of our user interface](https://gabeclasson.github.io/pl-ucb-environmentdiagrams/frontend-demo.html),
which will allow you to create an environment diagram as a student would but will not allow you to save or grade it. 

We've also created demo videos for both the instructor and the student interfaces, which you can see below. 

## SIGCSE TS
We presented a poster about our tool at the SIGCSE Technical Symposium in February 2025.

## Did you just have a course created for  you?

If so, this repo was used as a template, and your course repo's name should be `pl-SSS-CCC`, 
where `SSS` is your project
institution name (`ucb`, `csulb`, `ecc`) and `CCC` is the lowercase course
number at your institution (eg `pl-ucb-cs169a`, `pl-ecc-csci8`, etc).
    
We (UCB PL admins) should already have created a team
`pl-dev-SSS-CCC` that has write access to your repo; email us the
names of any course staff who should have access.  **WARNING:** your
repo will likely contain sensitive content such as exam questions.  Be
careful who has access.  **All access to PL repos is by teams**, not
by adding individuals, to keep access control manageable.

* Delete (meaning `git rm`) the `elements` subdirectory, unless you specifically want to use
the custom elements in here (see below for some documentation)
* Delete the contents of `serverFilesCourse` and `clientFilesCourse`
* Delete the contents of `courseInstances` (you'll add your own
later)
* Delete the contents of `questions/`, which will be replaced with
your course's questions
* Immediately update this `README.md` and `infoCourse.json` to
reflect the info for your course, including inserting a valid UUID for
the course.  You can run `uuidgen` at a shell prompt to make one.
**Important.** Just about every type of thing in PL -- course, question, element, etc. -- has a UUID (Universally Unique ID).  You can generate one by typing `uuidgen` at a terminal window or by using the [UUID generator](https://www.uuidgenerator.net). For safety, in the template repo all UUID values have been set to "9999...".  **In your new repo, immediately `git rm` any files you do not need, and in the files that remain, replace every UUID with a fresh one.**


**Note:** Although it has become customary to name the primary Git
branch `main` rather than `master`, **do not do so for PL repos** as
the server will not be able to sync them.  The server will only sync
to the `master` branch.
